## About This Mod

Omoshiroi Kamo is an open-source collection of modern mod backports for Minecraft 1.7.10.
It brings newer mod from later Minecraft versions back into legacy modpacks.

Prefer for 1.7.10 tech packs, or any old-version modpack that wants modern features.
Being open-source, contributions are always welcome — if you have ideas, fixes, or improvements,
I’d be thrilled to see them!
